The aim of this project was to prove the feasibility of adding an extra shifter once a weekend to improve the current shifts for the emergency department of a hospital.
The department includes 6 residents that work for a period of 28 days. Shifts are 12 hours and split into AM and PM
There a few requirements:
- Need 3 residents on call in the AM, and 2 in the PM (except saturdays where a 7th resident will take the overnight/PM shift
- Work at most 6 days consecutively
- IF you work overnight, you may not work a day shift the next day or day after that (to balance sleep schedule and reduce fatigue)
- We also added a constraint to balance out days off and PM shifts so they are evenly spread out to make it more fair.

The objective function was the maximization of days worked since the bounds were set well by the constraints above.


To visualize the results we used an Excel spreadsheet/Pivot Table to review it's feasibility. This will later be automated into a better visualization.
The doctor in charge reviewed the results and deemed it feasible to use this tool to automate shift scheduling, even without the 7th relieving shiftee.
